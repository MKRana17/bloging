            Rajput (from Sanskrit: राजपुत्र rājaputra meaning "son of a king"), also called Thakur,[6] is a large
            multi-component cluster of castes, kin bodies, and local groups, sharing social status and ideology of
            genealogical descent originating from the Indian subcontinent. The term Rajput covers various patrilineal
            clans historically associated with warriorhood: several clans claim Rajput status, although not all claims
            are universally accepted. According to modern scholars, almost all Rajput clans originated from peasant or
            pastoral communities.

            Over time, the Rajputs emerged as a social class comprising people from a variety of ethnic and geographical
            backgrounds. From 12th to 16th centuries, the membership of this class became largely hereditary, although
            new claims to Rajput status continued to be made in the later centuries. Several Rajput-ruled kingdoms
            played a significant role in many regions of central and northern India from seventh century onwards.

            The Rajput population and the former Rajput states are found in northern, western, central and eastern India
            as well as southern and eastern Pakistan. These areas include Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat, Eastern Punjab,
            Western Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Sindh.

            Early references
            The word rājaputra (Sanskrit: राजपुत्र; literally "son of a king") finds mention in some ancient Hindu
            scriptures like the Rigveda, Ramayana and Mahabharata.[7] The word first appears in a sense other than its
            literal meaning in the 7th century Bakshali manuscript from NWFP in reference to a mercenary soldier, while
            in the 8th century Chachnama of Sindh, it is used in the sense of elite horsemen.[8] Andre Wink notes that
            the military nobility of Sindh ruler Dahir to which the Chachnama and Al-Baladhuri refer as thakurs can be
            seen as Rajputs in the original sense of the word.[9] In the 12th century Rajtarangini, it has been used in
            the sense of a landowner.[10]

            Scholars' views
            The origin of the Rajputs has been a much-debated topic among historians. Historian Satish Chandra states:
            "Modern historians are more or less agreed that the Rajputs consisted of miscellaneous groups including
            Shudra and tribals. Some were Brahmans who took to warfare, and some were from Tribes- indigenous or
            foreign". Thus, the Rajput community formation was a result of political factors that influenced caste
            mobility, called Sanskritization by some scholars and Rajputization by others.[11][12] Modern scholars agree
            that nearly all Rajputs clans originated from peasant or pastoral communities.[13][14][15][16][17] <br>

            Alf Hiltebeitel discusses three theories by Raj era and early writers for Rajput origin and gives the
            reasons as to why these theories are dismissed by modern research. British colonial-era writers
            characterised Rajputs as descendants of the foreign invaders such as the Scythians or the Hunas, and
            believed that the Agnikula myth was invented to conceal their foreign origin.[18] According to this theory,
            the Rajputs originated when these invaders were assimilated into the Kshatriya category during the 6th or
            7th century, following the collapse of the Gupta Empire.[19][20] While many of these colonial writers
            propagated this foreign-origin theory in order to legitimise the colonial rule, the theory was also
            supported by some Indian scholars, such as D. R. Bhandarkar.[18] The second theory was promulgated by C.V.
            Vaidya who believed in the Aryan invasion theory and that the entire 9th-10th century Indian populace was
            composed of only one race - the Aryans who had not yet mixed with the Shudras or Dravidians. Nationalist
            historians Vaidya and R.B. Singh write that the Rajputs had originated from the Vedic Aryan Kshatriyas of
            the epics - Ramayana and Mahabharata. Vaidya bases this theory on certain attributes - such as bravery and
            "physical strength" of Draupadi and Kausalya and the bravery of the Rajputs. However, Hiltebeitel says that
            such "affinities do not point to an unbroken continuity between an ancient epic period" in the Vedic period
            (3500 BCE - 3000 BCE according to Vaidya) and the "great Rajput tradition" that started in sixteenth-century
            Rajasthan instead "raise the question of similarities between the epics' allusions to Vedic Vratya warbands
            and earlier medieval low status Rajput clans". Hiltebeitel concludes that such attempts to trace Rajputs
            from epic and Vedic sources are "unconvincing"[21] and cites Nancy MacLean and B.D. Chattopadhyaya to label
            Vaidya's historiography on Rajputs as "often hopeless".[22] A third group of historians, which includes Jai
            Narayan Asopa, theorised that the Rajputs were Brahmins who became rulers. However, such "one track
            arguments" and "contrived evidence" such as shape of the head, cultural stereotypes, etc. are dismissed by
            Hiltebeitel who refers to such claims and Asopa's epic references as "far-fetched" or "unintelligible".[23]
            <br>

            Recent research suggests that the Rajputs came from a variety of ethnic and geographical backgrounds[24] and
            various varnas.[25][26] Tanuja Kothiyal states: "In the colonial ethnographic accounts rather than referring
            to Rajputs as having emerged from other communities, Bhils, Mers, Minas, Gujars, Jats, Raikas, all lay a
            claim to a Rajput past from where they claim to have 'fallen'. Historical processes, however, suggest just
            the opposite".[27] <br>

            The word "rajput" meant 'horse soldier', 'trooper', 'headman of a village' or 'subordinate chief' before the
            15th century. Individuals with whom the word "rajput" was associated before the 15th century were considered
            varna–samkara ("mixed caste origin") and inferior to Kshatriya. Over time, the term "Rajput" came to denote
            a hereditary political status, which was not necessarily very high: the term could denote a wide range of
            rank-holders, from an actual son of a king to the lowest-ranked landholder.[28][29][30][31][32][33] <br>

            According to scholars, in medieval times "the political units of India were probably ruled most often by men
            of very low birth" and this "may be equally applicable for many clans of 'Rajputs' in northern India".
            Burton Stein explains that this process of allowing rulers, frequently of low social origin, a "clean" rank
            via social mobility in the Hindu Varna system serves as one of the explanations of the longevity of the
            unique Indian civilisation.[34][35][36]
            <br>

            The medieval tales on Pabuji depicting Rajput, Charan, Bhil and Rabari warriors fighting side by side as
            well as other medival and contemporary texts show claims made by Nomadic tribes of the Thar desert to a
            higher rank in the society.[37]
            <br>

            Gradually, the term Rajput came to denote a social class, which was formed when the various tribal and
            nomadic groups became landed aristocrats, and transformed into the ruling class.[38] These groups assumed
            the title "Rajput" as part of their claim to higher social positions and ranks.[39] The early medieval
            literature suggests that this newly formed Rajput class comprised people from multiple castes.[40] Thus, the
            Rajput identity is not the result of a shared ancestry. Rather, it emerged when different social groups of
            medieval India sought to legitimise their newly acquired political power by claiming Kshatriya status. These
            groups started identifying as Rajput at different times, in different ways. Thus, modern scholars summarise
            that Rajputs were a "group of open status" since the eighth century, mostly illiterate warriors who claimed
            to be reincarnates of ancient Indian Kshatriyas – a claim that had no historical basis. Moreover, this
            unfounded Kshatriya status claim showed a sharp contrast to the classical varna of Kshatriyas as depicted in
            Hindu literature in which Kshatriyas are depicted as an educated and urbanite clan.[41][42][43][44][45]
            Historian Thomas R. Metcalf mentions the opinion of Indian scholar K. M. Panikkar who also considers the
            famous Rajput dynasties of medieval India to have come from non-Kshatriya castes.
            <br>


            Stewart Gordon writes that during the era of the Mughal empire, hypergamous marriage "marrying up", combined
            with service in the state army was another way a tribal family could "become" Rajput. This process required
            a change in dress, diet, worship, and other traditions, ending widow remarriage, for example. Such a
            marriage between someone from a tribal family, and a member of an acknowledged - but possibly poor - Rajput
            family, would ultimately enable the non-Rajput family to rise to Rajput status. This marriage pattern
            supports the fact that Rajput was an "open caste category", available to those who served the Mughals.[47]

            <br>

            Rajput formation continued in the colonial era. Even in the 19th century, anyone from the "village landlord"
            to the "newly wealthy lower caste Shudra" could employ Brahmins to retrospectively fabricate a genealogy and
            within a couple of generations they would gain acceptance as Hindu Rajputs. This process would get mirrored
            by communities in north India. This process of origin of the Rajput community resulted in hypergamy as well
            as female infanticide that was common in Hindu Rajput clans. Scholars refer to this as "Rajputization",
            which, like Sanskritization, was a mode for upward mobility, but it differed from Sanskritization in other
            attributes, like the method of worship, lifestyle, diet, social interaction, rules for women, and marriage,
            etc. German historian Hermann Kulke has coined the term "Secondary Rajputization" for describing the process
            of members of a tribe trying to re-associate themselves with the former chief of their tribe who had already
            transformed himself into a Rajput via Rajputization and thus become Rajputs themselves.[48][49][50][25][26]

            <br>

            According to some scholars, the term rajputra was reserved for the immediate relatives of a king; scholars
            like BD Chattopadhyay believe that it was used for a larger group of high-ranking men.[51]
